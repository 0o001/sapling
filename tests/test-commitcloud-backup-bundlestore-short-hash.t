Test `hg up` command for the commit that doesn't exist locally but does remotely.
We are making commit in repo (server) and will recover it in client 1 via short hash.

Test `hg up` command for the commit that doesn't exist locally
Also doesn't exist remotely
But can be recovered from backup
We are making a test commit in client 1 and will recover it from client2
We will also run few checks with `hg hide` / `hg up` commands.

  $ hg clone ssh://user@dummy/repo client1 -q
  $ cd client1
  $ mkcommit someothercommit
  $ hg log -r .

Quick test `hg hide` / `hg up`
Check update now accesses hidden commits rather than trying to pull

  $ hg hide c1b6fe8fce73
  hiding commit c1b6fe8fce73 "someothercommit"

  $ hg up c1b6fe8fce73

Test that updating to new head after hiding current head works as expected.
  $ hg up -q ".^"
  $ mkcommit newheadcommit
  $ hg hide -r "."
  hiding commit 5862354b0f4f "newheadcommit"

Test pulling a commit with the same prefix by creating fake files

Clean up from the previous tests
  $ rm -r ./client1

Set up similar test but with sql infinitepush storage
The test scenario will cover several different lengths of prefix
