Usage: $PROGNAME <src> <dst>

This script enables the Mercurial share extension, shares a repository from
'src' to 'dst', and copies the .hg/hgrc configuration from 'src' to 'dst'.
This allows sharing repositories with non-standard configurations like we have
here at Facebook.

In the future, this functionality will probably be folded into the share
extension directly.
