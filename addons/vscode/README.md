# Sapling SCM

Sapling is a Scalable, User-Friendly Source Control System.

This extension provides integrations with Sapling, including a webview Interactive Smartlog UI,
like you would get from running `sl web`.

[See our documentation to learn more about Sapling.](https://sapling-scm.com/)

**Note: This extension does not include Sapling SCM itself. You must install Sapling SCM through the [normal installation instructions](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/introduction/installation)
in order for the vscode extension to work.**
