"""publishes state-enter and state-leave events to Watchman

Extension that is responsible for publishing state-enter and state-leave
events to Watchman for the following states:

- hg.filemerge
- hg.update

(Note that fsmonitor publishes state-enter and state-leave events for
hg.transaction.)

This was originally part of the fsmonitor extension, but it was split into its
own extension that can be used with Eden. (Note that fsmonitor is supposed to be
disabled when 'eden' is in repo.requirements.)

Note that hg.update state changes must be published to Watchman in order for it
to support SCM-aware subscriptions:
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/scm-query.html.
