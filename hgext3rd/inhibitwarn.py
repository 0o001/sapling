# inhibitwarn.py - Warn beta evolve users of the new inhibit extension

# Copyright 2015 Facebook, Inc.
#
# As we are rolling out inhibit, our evolve beta testers have to change their
# config to keep using evolve unhinibitted as before. The goal of this extension
# is to warn these users about inhibit and tell them how to deactivate it.
#
# To know who those users are we check the date of oldest obsolescence marker.
