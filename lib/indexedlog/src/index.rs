//! [u8] -> [u64] mapping. Insertion only.
//!
//! The index could be backed by a combination of an on-disk file, and in-memory content. Changes
//! to the index will be buffered in memory forever until an explicit flush. Internally, the index
//! uses base16 radix tree for keys and linked list of values, though it's possible to extend the
//! format to support other kinds of trees and values.
//!
//! File format:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! INDEX       := HEADER + ENTRY_LIST
//! HEADER      := '\0'  (takes offset 0, so 0 is not a valid offset for ENTRY)
//! ENTRY_LIST  := RADIX | ENTRY_LIST + ENTRY
//! ENTRY       := RADIX | LEAF | LINK | KEY | ROOT
//! RADIX       := '\2' + JUMP_TABLE (16 bytes) + PTR(LINK) + PTR(RADIX | LEAF) * N
//! LEAF        := '\3' + PTR(KEY) + PTR(LINK)
//! LINK        := '\4' + VLQ(VALUE) + PTR(NEXT_LINK | NULL)
//! KEY         := '\5' + VLQ(KEY_LEN) + KEY_BYTES
//! ROOT        := '\1' + PTR(RADIX) + ROOT_LEN (1 byte)
//!
//! PTR(ENTRY)  := VLQ(the offset of ENTRY)
//! ```
//!
//! Some notes about the format:
//!
//! - A "RADIX" entry has 16 children. This is mainly for source control hex hashes. The "N"
//!   in a radix entry could be less than 16 if some of the children are missing (ex. offset = 0).
//!   The corresponding jump table bytes of missing children are 0s. If child i exists, then
//!   `jumptable[i]` is the relative (to the beginning of radix entry) offset of PTR(child offset).
//! - A "ROOT" entry its length recorded as the last byte. Normally the root entry is written
//!   at the end. This makes it easier for the caller - it does not have to record the position
//!   of the root entry. The caller could optionally provide a root location.
//! - An entry has a 1 byte "type". This makes it possible to do a linear scan from the
//!   beginning of the file, instead of having to go through a root. Potentially useful for
//!   recovery purpose, or adding new entry types (ex. tree entries other than the 16-children
//!   radix entry, value entries that are not u64 linked list, key entries that refers external
//!   buffer).
//! - The "JUMP_TABLE" in "RADIX" entry stores relative offsets to the actual value of
//!   RADIX/LEAF offsets. It has redundant information. The more compact form is a 2-byte
//!   (16-bit) bitmask but that hurts lookup performance.
