//! treedirstate - Tree-based Directory State.
//!
//! This is a Rust implementation of the dirstate concept for Mercurial, using a tree structure
//! in an append-only storage back-end.
//!
//! The directory state stores information for all files in a working copy that are of interest
//! to Mercurial.  In particular, for each file in the working copy it stores the mode flags,
//! size, and modification time of the file.  These can be compared with current values to
//! determine if the file has changed.
//!
//! The directory state also stores files that are in the working copy parent manifest but have
//! been marked as removed.
