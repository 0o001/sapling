bonsai core data, chunked, deep, with checkpointing enabled

inspect the checkpoint table
  $ sqlite3 "$TESTTMP/test_sqlite" "select repo_id, checkpoint_name, lower_bound, upper_bound from walker_checkpoints;"

same run, but against metadata db

test restoring from checkpoint, scrub should have no chunks to do as checkpoint loaded covers the repo bounds
  $ mononoke_walker -L sizing -L graph scrub -q -p Changeset --chunk-size=2 --checkpoint-name=bonsai_deep --checkpoint-path=test_sqlite -I deep -i bonsai -i FileContent 2>&1 | strip_glog

  Completed in 2 chunks of size 2

run to a new checkpoint name, with checkpoint sampling set so that last chunk not included in checkpoint
  $ mononoke_walker -L sizing -L graph scrub -q -p Changeset --chunk-size=1 --checkpoint-sample-rate=2 --checkpoint-name=bonsai_deep2 --checkpoint-path=test_sqlite -I deep -i bonsai -i FileContent 2>&1 | strip_glog

run again, should have no catchup, but main bounds will continue from checkpoint
  $ mononoke_walker -L sizing -L graph scrub -q -p Changeset --chunk-size=1 --checkpoint-sample-rate=2 --checkpoint-name=bonsai_deep2 --checkpoint-path=test_sqlite -I deep -i bonsai -i FileContent 2>&1 | strip_glog

additional commit
  $ cd repo-hg
  $ mkcommit D
  $ cd ..
  $ blobimport repo-hg/.hg repo

run again, should catchup with new data since checkpoint and nothing to do in main bounds
  $ mononoke_walker -L sizing -L graph scrub -q -p Changeset --chunk-size=2 --checkpoint-name=bonsai_deep --checkpoint-path=test_sqlite -I deep -i bonsai -i FileContent 2>&1 | strip_glog

setup for both a catchup due to a new commit, plus continuation from a checkpoint.  First create the partial checkpoint by setting sample rate

now the additional commit
  $ cd repo-hg
  $ mkcommit E
  $ cd ..
  $ blobimport repo-hg/.hg repo

finally, should have a run with both catchup and main bounds
