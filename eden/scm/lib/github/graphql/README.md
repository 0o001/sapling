# .graphql files

`schema.docs.graphql` is the schema for GitHub's GraphQL API. This version was
downloaded from https://docs.github.com/public/schema.docs.graphql on
April 12, 2022. Unfortunately, we could not find a more "authoritative" source
for this file with a verifiable version history. We looked at
https://github.com/octokit/graphql-schema, but at the time of this writing,
it was last updated on Oct 3, 2021, and appears less complete than the
version we downloaded from https://docs.github.com/.
