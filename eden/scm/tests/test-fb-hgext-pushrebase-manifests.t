This test does two things:

1/ Simulate a common condition of pushrebase under load. Normally pushrebase
caches data before acquiring the write lock (if lazy locking is enabled).
Under load, however, when a push has to wait for the lock more often than not,
much of this data becomes out of date and must be refetched once the lock is
acquired. This test simulates that particular case.
Specifically, we create two clients, client1 and client2, both with
nonconflicting changesets to push. client1's push is artificially blocked by a
`prepushrebase` hook (post-caching, pre-lock) that is only released after
client2's push succeeds.

2/ Checks how often we call manifest.read() inside the lock (and outside).

This way we can prevent regressions on manifest reads and test improvements.
manifest.read() is wrapped by an extension that prints a short trace. read calls
inside the lock are marked with a ":(".

Set up server repository

  $ hg init server
  $ cd server
  $ config
  $ echo foo > base
  $ commit "[base] (zero'th)"
  adding base

Clone client1 and client2 from the server repo.

  $ cd ..
  $ clone client1
  $ cd ..
  $ clone client2

Make some non-conflicting commits in all three repos.
  $ cd ../server
  $ echo 'bar' > srv
  $ commit 'srv => bar (first)'
  adding srv
  $ log
  @  srv => bar (first) [draft:2d83594e8405]
  |
  o  [base] (zero'th) [draft:a9156650d8dd]
  
  $ cd ../client1
  $ echo 'xxx' > c1
  $ commit 'c1 => xxx (third)'
  adding c1
  $ echo 'baz' > c1
  $ commit 'c1 => baz (fourth)'
  $ log
  @  c1 => baz (fourth) [draft:1fe62957ca8a]
  |
  o  c1 => xxx (third) [draft:8cf3b846b3a4]

  $ cd ../client2
  $ log
  @  [base] (zero'th) [public:a9156650d8dd]
  
  $ echo 'yyy' > c2
  $ commit 'c2 => yyy (second)'
  adding c2

Add an extension that logs whenever `manifest.readmf()` is called when the lock is held.
  $ cat >> $TESTTMP/manifestcheck.py <<EOF

Add a hook to the server to make it spin until .hg/flag exists.
  $ cd ../server
  $ echo "[extensions]" >> .hg/hgrc
  $ echo "manifestcheck=$TESTTMP/manifestcheck.py" >> .hg/hgrc
  $ cp .hg/hgrc .hg/hgrc.bak
  $ echo "[hooks]" >> .hg/hgrc
  $ echo "prepushrebase.wait=python:$TESTDIR/hgsql/waithook.py:waithook" >> .hg/hgrc

Push from client1 -> server and detach. The background job will wait for
.hg/flag.
  $ cd ../client1
  $ hg push --to default 2>&1 | \sed "s/^/[client1 push] /" &

Wait for the first push to actually enter the hook before removing it.
  $ cd ../server
  $ while [ ! -f ".hg/hookrunning" ]; do sleep 0.01; done

Remove the hook.
  $ cp .hg/hgrc.bak .hg/hgrc

Push from client2 -> server. This should go through immediately without
blocking. There shouldn't be any "[client1 push]" output here.
  $ cd ../client2
  $ hg push --to default 2>&1 | \sed "s/^/[client2 push] /"
