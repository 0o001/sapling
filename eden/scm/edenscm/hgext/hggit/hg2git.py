class IncrementalChangesetExporter(object):
    """Incrementally export Mercurial changesets to Git trees.

    The purpose of this class is to facilitate Git tree export that is more
    optimal than brute force.

    A "dumb" implementations of Mercurial to Git export would iterate over
    every file present in a Mercurial changeset and would convert each to
    a Git blob and then conditionally add it to a Git repository if it didn't
    yet exist. This is suboptimal because the overhead associated with
    obtaining every file's raw content and converting it to a Git blob is
    not trivial!

    This class works around the suboptimality of brute force export by
    leveraging the information stored in Mercurial - the knowledge of what
    changed between changesets - to only export Git objects corresponding to
    changes in Mercurial. In the context of converting Mercurial repositories
    to Git repositories, we only export objects Git (possibly) hasn't seen yet.
    This prevents a lot of redundant work and is thus faster.

    Callers instantiate an instance of this class against a mercurial.localrepo
    instance. They then associate it with a specific changesets by calling
    update_changeset(). On each call to update_changeset(), the instance
    computes the difference between the current and new changesets and emits
    Git objects that haven't yet been encountered during the lifetime of the
    class instance. In other words, it expresses Mercurial changeset deltas in
    terms of Git objects. Callers then (usually) take this set of Git objects
    and add them to the Git repository.

    This class only emits Git blobs and trees, not commits.

    The tree calculation part of this class is essentially a reimplementation
    of dulwich.index.commit_tree. However, since our implementation reuses
    Tree instances and only recalculates SHA-1 when things change, we are
    more efficient.

        have nodeids. Trees do not correspond to a specific nodeid, so it does
        not make sense to emit a nodeid for them.

        returned dulwich object to the Git repo via the store's add_object().
