   * tryRemoveChild() actually unlinks a child from our entry list.
   *
   * The caller must already be holding the mountpoint-wide RenameLock.
   *
   * This method also updates the overlay state if the child was removed
   * successfully.
   *
   * @param renameLock A reference to the rename lock (this parameter is
   *     required mostly to ensure that the caller is holding it).
   * @param name The entry name to remove.
   * @param child If this parameter is non-null, then only remove the entry if
   *     it refers to the specified inode.  If the entry does not refer to the
   *     inode in question, EBADF will be returned.
   * @param flushKernelCache This parameter indicates if we should tell the
   *     kernel to flush its cache for the removed entry.  This should always
   *     be set to true, unless tryRemoveChild() is being called from a FUSE
   *     unlink() or rmdir() call, in which case the kernel will update its
   *     cache automatically when the FUSE call returns.
   *
   * @return Returns an errno value on error, or 0 on success.  Notable errors
   * include:
   * - ENOENT: no entry exists the specified name
   * - EBADF: An entry exists with the specified name, but the InodeBase object
   *   for it is not loaded, or it does not refer to the same inode as the
   *   child parameter (if child was non-null).
   * - EISDIR: the entry with the specified name is a directory (only returned
   *   if InodePtrType is FileInodePtr).
   * - ENOTDIR: the entry with the specified name is not a directory (only
   *   returned if InodePtrType is TreeInodePtr).
   * - ENOTEMPTY: the directory being removed is not empty.
   *
   * Callers should assume that tryRemoveChild() may still throw an exception
   * on other unexpected error cases.
