 * This is designed to be a simple implemenation of an Hg dirstate. It's
 * "simple" in that every call to `getStatus()` walks the entire overlay to
 * determine which files have been added/modified/removed, and then compares
 * those files with the base commit to determine the appropriate Hg status code.
 *
 * Ideally, we would cache information between calls to `getStatus()` to make
 * this more efficient, but this seems like an OK place to start. Once we have
 * a complete implementation built that is supported by a battery of tests, then
 * we can try to optimize things.
 *
 * For the moment, let's assume that we have the invariant that every file that
 * has been modified since the "base commit" exists in the overlay. This means
 * that we do not allow a non-commit snapshot to remove files from the overlay.
 * Rather, the only time the overlay gets "cleaned up" is in response to a
 * commit or an update.
 *
 * This may not be what we want in the long run, but we need to get basic
 * Mercurial stuff working first before we can worry about snapshots.
