/**
 * A GitIgnore object represents the contents of a single .gitignore file
 *
 * To determine if a path should be included or excluded, you normally must
 * search through multiple separate GitIgnore objects.  These should be
 * processed in the following order (from highest precedence to lowest):
 *
 * - The .gitignore file in the directory containing the path.
 * - The .gitignore file in each subsequent parent directory, all the way up to
 *   the root of the repository.
 * - Any eden client-wide exclude file
 * - The user's personal exclude file.
 *
 * At each step, the GitIgnore object may return that the path was explicitly
 * excluded, explicitly included, or was not matched.  If the path was
 * explicitly excluded or included, stop and use that result.  Otherwise
 * proceed to the next highest precedence GitIgnore object.
 *
 * If a directory is ignored, everything inside it is always ignored.  Files
 * inside this directory may be explicitly added to source control, but
 * untracked files inside this directory (and any children directories) are
 * always ignored: explicit include rules cannot be used to unignore files
 * inside an ignored directory.
