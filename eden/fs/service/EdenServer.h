/*
 * EdenServer contains logic for running the Eden main loop.
 *
 * It performs locking to ensure only a single EdenServer instance is running
 * for a particular location, then starts the thrift management server
 * and the fuse session.
 *
 * The general usage model to run an EdenServer is:
 * - Call prepare().
 * - Run the thrift server.  The server object can be obtained by calling
 *   getServer().  When the thrift server stops this indicates the EdenServer
 *   is done and should be shut down.
 * - Call performCleanup() to let the EdenServer shut down.  This includes
 *   unmounting FUSE mounts or, if a graceful restart was requested,
 *   transferring state to the new process.
 *
 * These are 3 separate steps to provide the caller with flexibility around
 * exactly how they drive the thrift server object.
