    Helper function for recursively building a large branching directory
    tree.

    path is the leading path prefix to put before all directory names.

    fanouts is an array of integers specifying the directory fan-out
    dimensions.  One layer of directories will be created for each element
    in this array.  e.g., [3, 4] would create 3 subdirectories inside the
    top-level directory, and 4 subdirectories in each of those 3
    directories.

    Calls leaf_function on all leaf directories.
    Calls internal_function on all internal (non-leaf) directories.
